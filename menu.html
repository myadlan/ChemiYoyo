    Chemistry Form Five: Chapter 1 - Rate of Reaction
</p>
<p>
    Rate of reaction = change of quantity in reactant or product per unit time.
</p>
<p>
    We usually use water displacement method to collect gas in school laboratory as shown below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            The <strong>reaction is fastest at the start</strong> when the reactants are at a maximum (steepest gradient)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The <strong>gradient becomes progressively less</strong> as reactants are used up and the reaction slows down.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Finally the <strong>graph levels out when one of the reactants is used up</strong> and the reaction stops.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The <strong>amount of product depends on the amount of reactants used.</strong>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The <strong>initial rate of reaction is obtained by measuring the gradient at the start of the reaction</strong>. A tangent line is drawn to
            measure rate of reaction at instataneous time.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Chemistry Form 5: Chapter 1 - Collision Theory
</p>
<p>
    According to the collision theory, particles of reactant that achieve activation energy and collide with correct orientation will result in reaction.

    2. Activation Energy
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Activation energy is the minimum amount of energy that must be overcome by the colliding particles so that the reaction can occur.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Chemistry Form 5: Chapter 1 - Effect of Concentration on Rate of Reaction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <u><strong>Experiment to show the effect of concentration on reaction rate</strong></u>
</p>
<p>
    <br/>
    Sodium thiosulphate solution react with dilute sulphuric acid to form a yellow precipitate of sulphur. In this experiment, the time taken for the formation
    of sulphur to cover the mark 'X' until it disappears from sight can be used to measure rate of reaction.
</p>
<p align="CENTER">
    As the concentration of sulphuric acid is increased, the rate of reaction between sulphuric acid and sodium thiosulphate increases.
</p>
<p>
    <u><strong>Explanation using collision theory</strong></u>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    · When the concentration of the solution of a reactant increases, the number of particles per unit volume of the solution also increases.
</p>
<p>
    · With more particles per unit volume of the solution of the reactant, the frequency of collision increases.
</p>
<p>
    · This causes the frequency of effective collision to increase. Hence, the rate of reaction increases.
</p>
<p>
    Chemistry Form 5: Chapter 1 - Catalyst Affects the Rate of Reaction
</p>
<p align="CENTER">
    Catalyst is a chemical substance that change the rate of chemical reaction.
</p>
<p>
    <br/>
    <u><strong>Characteristics of catalyst:</strong></u>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Catalyst remains chemically unchanged during reaction. Its chemical composition still the same before and after reaction.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Catalyst only change the rate of reaction.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Catalyst does not change the quantity of the product formed.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Catalyst is specific in its action.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Only a small amount of catalyst is needed to achieve a big increase in rate of reaction.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <u><strong>How catalyst increase the rate of reaction:</strong></u>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            When a positive catalyst is used in a chemical reaction, it enables the reaction to occur through an alternative path which requires lower
            activation energy.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            As a result, more colliding particles are able to overcome the lower activation energy.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            This causes the frequency of effective collision to increase.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Hence, the rate of reaction increases.
        </p>
